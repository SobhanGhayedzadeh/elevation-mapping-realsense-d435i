#### OMPL Planner Parameters ####
OmplPlanner:

  footprint: [[0.10, 0.10], [0.10, -0.10], [-0.10, -0.10], [-0.10, 0.10]]

  use_distance_threshold: true
  simplify_solution: true       # If 'true', some nodes in the path will be pruned
  trust_approx_solution: false
  verbose_planner: false
  enable_timer_collisions: true  # If 'true', the global planner will check for collision at 'replanning rate' and will replan if in collision
  
  distance_threshold: 1.0      # [-] If we find a path whose lenght is less or equal to (distance_threshold * straight line distance start-goal), then we stop planning
  goal_bias: 0.05              # [-] Bias in the sampling - with this probability we will sample the goal position
  tree_range: 3.0              # [m] Increase this to have longer branches in the RRT path (influence on the runtime. It represents the maximum length of a motion to be added in the tree of motions)
  interpolation_factor: 0.05   # [m] Factor for collision checking between two sampled poses
  num_seconds_to_plan: 2.0     # [s] Planning budget
  min_distance_waypoints: 0.01 # [m] Interpolation factor of the raw global path between nodes
  dist_goal_reached: 0.3       # [m] Threshold to consider the goal reached

  planner_type: 1              # 0: RRT Connect, 1: RRT*, 2: Informed RRT*, 3: PRM
  replanning_rate: 5.0         # [Hz] useless if 'enable_timer_collisions' is False
